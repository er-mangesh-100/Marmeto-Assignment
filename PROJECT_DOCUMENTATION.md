## Interview Questions & Answers

### **Basic Questions (1-10)**

**Q1: What is this project about?**
**A:** A responsive web application that simulates a Shopify-style product bundling system where users can select multiple products to create bundles and receive automatic discounts when certain thresholds are met.

**Q2: What technologies did you use?**
**A:** Pure HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript (ES6). No frameworks or libraries were used to keep it lightweight and demonstrate core web development skills.

**Q3: How many products are available in the bundle builder?**
**A:** 6 products total: Premium Headphones ($199.99), Wireless Speaker ($149.99), Smart Watch ($299.99), Bluetooth Earbuds ($89.99), Portable Charger ($59.99), and Phone Stand ($29.99).

**Q4: What triggers the discount in this application?**
**A:** When users select 3 or more products, a 30% discount is automatically applied to the entire bundle.

**Q5: How does the progress bar work?**
**A:** The progress bar fills from 0% to 100% based on the number of selected items, showing "X/3 added" and visually indicating how close the user is to unlocking the discount.

**Q6: What happens when you click "Add to Bundle"?**
**A:** The button toggles between "Add to Bundle" and "Added ✓", the product card gets a blue border, the product appears in the sidebar, and the progress/pricing updates in real-time.

**Q7: How is the pricing calculated?**
**A:** Subtotal = sum of all selected product prices. Discount = 30% of subtotal (if 3+ items). Total = subtotal - discount.

**Q8: What makes this application responsive?**
**A:** CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts, media queries for different screen sizes, and mobile-first design principles that adapt the layout from desktop (grid) to mobile (stacked).

**Q9: How do you remove items from the bundle?**
**A:** Users can click the "Remove" button in the sidebar for each selected product, or click the "Add to Bundle" button again on the product card to deselect it.

**Q10: What happens when you click "Add Bundle to Cart"?**
**A:** A success notification appears showing the bundle summary, items count, savings amount, and total price. The bundle data is logged to the console (simulating cart addition).

### **Technical Questions (11-20)**

**Q11: How did you manage state in this application?**
**A:** Used a Map object to store selected products with product IDs as keys and product data (name, price, image) as values. This provides efficient lookups and maintains order.

**Q12: Why did you choose Map over Array for storing selected products?**
**A:** Map provides O(1) lookup time, prevents duplicate entries, and makes it easy to check if a product is already selected using the `has()` method.

**Q13: How did you handle the button state changes?**
**A:** Used CSS classes and dynamic content updates. When a product is selected, the button gets an "added" class, text changes to "Added ✓", and the icon switches from plus to check mark.

**Q14: Explain the CSS Grid layout used in this project.**
**A:** Used `grid-template-columns: 1fr 350px` for the main layout (product grid + sidebar) and `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr))` for the product grid to create responsive cards.

**Q15: How did you implement the progress bar animation?**
**A:** Used CSS transitions on the `width` property of the progress fill element, calculating the percentage based on selected items count divided by required items.

**Q16: What's the difference between `forEach` and `map` in your code?**
**A:** Used `forEach` for side effects (updating UI elements) and `map` for transforming data (creating product objects from selected products Map).

**Q17: How did you handle the discount calculation logic?**
**A:** Created a separate `calculateDiscount()` method that checks if selected items count >= required items, then applies the percentage discount to the subtotal.

**Q18: Explain the event delegation pattern used.**
**A:** Used `querySelectorAll()` to select all "Add to Bundle" buttons, then added event listeners to each. For removal, used inline `onclick` handlers for simplicity.

**Q19: How did you implement the success notification?**
**A:** Dynamically created a DOM element with inline styles, added CSS animations via JavaScript, and used `setTimeout` to remove it after 3 seconds.

**Q20: What's the purpose of `data-*` attributes in your HTML?**
**A:** Used `data-product-id` and `data-price` to store product information that JavaScript can access, keeping the markup semantic and the data easily retrievable.

### **Advanced Questions (21-30)**

**Q21: How would you scale this application for 100+ products?**
**A:** Implement pagination, lazy loading, search/filter functionality, and virtual scrolling. Use a backend API to fetch products dynamically and implement proper caching.

**Q22: What if you needed to persist the bundle state across page refreshes?**
**A:** Use `localStorage` to save the selected products Map, and restore the state on page load by parsing the stored data and updating the UI accordingly.

**Q23: How would you add quantity controls to each product?**
**A:** Add quantity input fields to each product card, update the pricing logic to multiply price by quantity, and modify the sidebar to show quantities for each selected product.

**Q24: What if you needed to support multiple discount tiers?**
**A:** Create a discount rules system with different thresholds (e.g., 3 items = 30%, 5 items = 40%, 7 items = 50%) and modify the `calculateDiscount()` method to check multiple conditions.

**Q25: How would you implement a "Save Bundle" feature?**
**A:** Add a "Save Bundle" button that stores the current selection with a custom name in localStorage, and create a "Load Bundle" dropdown to restore previously saved bundles.

**Q26: What if you needed to add product categories or filtering?**
**A:** Add category data to products, create filter buttons, and implement a `filterProducts()` method that shows/hides products based on selected categories.

**Q27: How would you add a "Compare Products" feature?**
**A:** Create a comparison modal that shows selected products side-by-side with their specifications, prices, and features in a table format.

**Q28: What if you needed to support different currencies?**
**A:** Implement an internationalization system using `Intl.NumberFormat` for currency formatting and store currency preference in localStorage or user settings.

**Q29: How would you add accessibility features?**
**A:** Add ARIA labels, keyboard navigation support, screen reader announcements, focus management, and ensure proper color contrast ratios.

**Q30: What if you needed to integrate with a real e-commerce backend?**
**A:** Replace static product data with API calls, implement proper error handling, add loading states, and use a state management library like Redux for complex state.

### **Problem-Solving Questions (31-35)**

**Q31: How would you debug if the discount wasn't applying correctly?**
**A:** Check the `calculateDiscount()` method, verify the selected products count, add console.log statements, and ensure the discount threshold logic is working properly.

**Q32: What if the progress bar wasn't updating visually?**
**A:** Check CSS transitions, verify the width calculation, ensure the progress fill element exists, and confirm the percentage calculation is correct.

**Q33: How would you handle a scenario where product images fail to load?**
**A:** Add `onerror` handlers to images, provide fallback images, and implement a loading state with skeleton screens or placeholder content.

**Q34: What if you needed to support touch gestures on mobile?**
**A:** Add touch event listeners, implement swipe gestures for product selection, and ensure proper touch target sizes (minimum 44px) for mobile usability.

**Q35: How would you optimize the performance for large product catalogs?**
**A:** Implement virtual scrolling, lazy load images, use CSS containment, minimize DOM manipulations, and consider using a virtual DOM library for complex updates.
